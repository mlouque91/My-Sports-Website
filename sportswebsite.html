<h1>Welcome to Mike's Sports Page</h1>

	<p>This page is a collection of my favorite sports teams, athletes, and memories. Enjoy.</p>



<h2>The Baltimore Ravens</h2>

	<p>The Ravens are my favorite team and football is my favorite sport. God Bless the NFL.</p>

<h2>The Baltimore Orioles</h2>

	<p>I have a complicated history with the Orioles. They've brought me some joy over the years, but overall, the franchise has been a mess over the past 25 years.</p>

<h2>The PGA</h2>

	<p>I love professional golf and it's probably my second-favorite sport. There is nothing like watching a Sunday round during a major championship. The players experience nerves and they are on an island during that Sunday round... there are no teammates to lean on!</p>
